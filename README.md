# JavaScript Quiz App
----
A small app created for the purpose of learning a JavaScript programming language. The emphasis was on developing a good understanding of the basic priniciples of plain 'vanilla' JavaScript without any additional libraries (i.e., jQuery).

##Concept 
- A guiding principle was to implement a separation of the application data, logic and the UI manipulation part
- Application has 3 main objects: 
    - **data** object stores all the quiz content (questions and answers) in array of objects 
	- **display** object contains a methods and properties for updating the DOM
	- **control** object handles an application logic
